# Goopify
### A custom goop editor for Super Mario Sunshine!
Information about how goop works: http://smswiki.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Docs/Pollution

#### What's currently done:
* Importing collision files (.col) to view in the 3D viewer
* UV unwrapping for models to display what the goop would look like
* Cutting the model into section to use for the goop model

#### Features that are currently in progress:
* Create and resize sections from the .col that you would want to have goop on
* Globally and individually edit settings for goop regions
* Edit the texture the goop uses and the textures used to paint the goop on
* Porting Yoshi2's python goop script to create the .ymap file
* Exporting the goop models into formated ready-to-use .bmd flies
